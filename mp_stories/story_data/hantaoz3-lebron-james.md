I'm Lebron James and I'm now making maybe the most important decision in my life: whether to keep playing basketball. For years I've enjoyed so much in this league, but all those games also make me tired, tired of being a professional, tired of facing all those medias, tired of getting involved into all those things outside basketball. Maybe it's time for me to reconsider my own life.

Thinking of these stuff get me overwhelmed, I'll just leave them behind.
