A few moments later.
9:20 p.m. Sun
What a coffee, this maybe the only thing that is really good at this moment. Why am I still thinking of those unrealistic problems, they only make me stressed. I should be proud of being in the league: focusing on what I can do is the priority now.

It's still early, just watch some TV to relax, still get a meeting with boss tomorrow.

#leb-read-newspaper
Wait there is today's newspaper, haven't got time to read it through due to the training in the morning.
