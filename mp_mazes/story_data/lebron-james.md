I'm Lebron James and I'm now making maybe the most important decision in my life: whether to keep playing basketball. For years I've enjoyed so much in this league, but all those games also make me tired, tired of being a professional, tired of facing all those medias, tired of getting involved into all those things outside basketball. Maybe it's time for me to reconsider my own life.

I need to go out for some fresh air.

A cup of coffee can help me thinking.

Thinking of these stuff get me overwhelmed, I'll just leave them behind.
